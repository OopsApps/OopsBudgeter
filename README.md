## **How OopsBudgeter Works**

1. **Track Income or Expenses**: Add transactions by selecting type, amount, description, category, and date.
1.5. **Add Unconfirmed Amounts**: Enter amounts like `40.25 !` to mark a transaction as unconfirmed until you're sure. *Perfect for ‚Äúprobably spent it, not sure how much though‚Äù moments.*
2. **View Financial Analytics**: Get a breakdown of spending habits, trends, and AI-powered insights. *Aka: How much money you‚Äôve wasted.*
3. **Monitor Your No-Spend Streak**: See how long you've gone without unnecessary expenses. *Spoiler alert: It won‚Äôt be long.*
4. **Print or Download Transactions**: Export transactions in **CSV** or **JSON** format. *So you can cry over them later.*
5. **Forecast Future Transactions**: View predictive transactions in greyed-out style with strikethroughs, representing future recurring incomes and expenses. *It's like fortune-telling, but sadder.*
6. **Plan Ahead with Predictions**: View projected spending based on trends. *Basically, a sneak peek into your future regrets.*

OopsBudgeter is your all-in-one finance tracker, **making sure you face your financial mistakes head-on! üöÄüòÇ**

> [!NOTE]  
> **Currency Handling in OopsBudgeter üí∞**  
>
> OopsBudgeter **stores all transactions in USD by default** for consistency across different currency selections.  
>
> - When you select a currency (e.g., **EUR**), the app **converts displayed amounts** using the latest exchange rate.  
> - Example: If **1 USD = 0.92 EUR**, then a **$100 transaction** is shown as **‚Ç¨92** in the UI.  
> - **New transactions follow the same rule**:  
>   - If you enter **‚Ç¨92**, it will be **saved as 100 USD** in the database.  
>   - If you switch to another currency later, the value will adjust accordingly.  
>
> üî• **This ensures your transactions remain globally consistent while allowing you to switch currencies anytime!** üåçüí∞
