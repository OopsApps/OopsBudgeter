# OopsBudgeter

OopsBudgeter is a personal finance management app designed to help users track their income and expenses. Built with **Next.js**, **React**, and **Tailwind CSS**, the app is **PWA** (Progressive Web App)-enabled and can be easily self-hosted with Docker. 

*(**Why made it?** Because who doesn't want a budget app that makes them realize how broke they are? ðŸ’¸ðŸ˜‚)*

## Features

- **Track income and expenses**: Easily manage transactions with details like amount, description, category, and date.
- **Advanced Analytics Dashboard**: Gain insights into your financial trends with detailed graphs and FakeAI-powered insights. *Yes, we graphically display your bad decisions!*
- **FakeAI-Powered Insights ðŸ¤–ðŸ“Š**: Automated spending analysis and financial recommendations (like, "Stop buying useless stuff!").
- **No-Spend Streaks**: Tracks how many consecutive days you've avoided spending. *Good luck breaking your record past a week!* ðŸ˜‚
- **PWA Support**: Works offline, and you can install it as a native app. *Now you can check your tragic finances even without internet!*
- **JWT-based authentication**: Secure your app with token-based authentication. *Hackers want your money? Jokeâ€™s on them, you donâ€™t have any!*
- **Customizable Currency**: Supports all ISO 4217 currencies. *Yes, even Monopoly money... but donâ€™t ask why.*
- **Passcode Protection**: Add a passcode to protect access to the app and API. *As if your bank account isnâ€™t already protecting itself.*
- **Responsive UI**: Built using Tailwind CSS for a clean and modern design.
